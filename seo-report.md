# SEO Audit Report

This report summarizes the findings from the SEO check of the website.

## High-Priority Issues

### 1. Inconsistent and Sub-optimal Heading Structure

- **Multiple `<h1>` Tags:** The `index.html` page has multiple `<h1>` tags. Each page should have only one `<h1>` tag to define the main topic of the page.
- **Recommendation:** Consolidate the main heading of each page into a single `<h1>` tag and use `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc. for subheadings.

### 2. Missing Meta Descriptions

- **Missing on Key Pages:** The `classes/class-10/index.html` page is missing a meta description. Other pages may also be missing this important tag.
- **Impact:** Meta descriptions are crucial for search engine result snippets. Without them, search engines will generate their own, which may not be as compelling to users.
- **Recommendation:** Add unique and descriptive meta descriptions to all important pages.

## Medium-Priority Issues

### 3. Incomplete Sitemap

- **Manual and Incomplete:** The `sitemap.xml` file appears to be manually created and does not include all the pages of the website.
- **Impact:** An incomplete sitemap can lead to search engines not discovering and indexing all of the site's content.
- **Recommendation:** Generate a complete sitemap automatically. There are many free tools available for this.

## Low-Priority Issues

### 4. Accessibility of SVGs

- **Missing `title` tags:** Some `<svg>` elements are missing a `<title>` tag, which acts as an accessible name for the graphic.
- **Impact:** This is a minor accessibility issue that can also have a small impact on SEO.
- **Recommendation:** Add a `<title>` tag to all SVG icons to describe their content.

## General Recommendations

1.  **Perform a Full Site Audit:** This report is based on a sample of pages. A full, automated SEO audit should be performed to identify all issues.
2.  **Keyword Strategy:** While the content seems relevant, a formal keyword strategy could help to better target user searches.
3.  **Image Alt Text:** Although the checked pages did not have images, it's crucial to ensure that all images on the site have descriptive `alt` text for both SEO and accessibility.

This report highlights the most pressing SEO issues found during the manual check. Addressing these issues will significantly improve the website's visibility and user experience.
