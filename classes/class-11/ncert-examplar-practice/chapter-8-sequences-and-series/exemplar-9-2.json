                    "answer": "x + y + 1 = 0",
                    "solution": "Let the equation of the line be x/a + y/b = 1. Given that intercepts are equal, so a = b. The equation becomes x/a + y/a = 1 or x + y = a. The line passes through (1, -2), so 1 + (-2) = a, which gives a = -1. Therefore, the equation of the line is x + y = -1, or x + y + 1 = 0."

                    "solution": "The slope of the line joining (2, 3) and (3, -1) is m1 = (-1 - 3) / (3 - 2) = -4. The slope of the required line, which is perpendicular to it, is m2 = -1/m1 = 1/4. The equation of the line passing through (5, 2) with slope 1/4 is y - 2 = (1/4)(x - 5). This simplifies to 4y - 8 = x - 5, or x - 4y + 3 = 0."

                    "solution": "The slope of the first line is m1 = 2 - √3. The slope of the second line is m2 = 2 + √3. The angle θ between them is given by tan(θ) = |(m2 - m1) / (1 + m1*m2)|. m2 - m1 = (2 + √3) - (2 - √3) = 2√3. 1 + m1*m2 = 1 + (2 - √3)(2 + √3) = 1 + (4 - 3) = 1 + 1 = 2. So, tan(θ) = |2√3 / 2| = √3.

                    "solution": "Let the intercepts be a and b. So, a + b = 14, or b = 14 - a. The equation is x/a + y/(14-a) = 1. It passes through (3, 4), so 3/a + 4/(14-a) = 1. This gives 3(14-a) + 4a = a(14-a) => 42 - 3a + 4a = 14a - a² => 42 + a = 14a - a² => a² - 13a + 42 = 0. Factoring gives (a-6)(a-7) = 0. So a = 6 or a = 7. If a = 6, b = 8. Eq: x/6 + y/8 = 1 => 4x + 3y = 24. If a = 7, b = 7. Eq: x/7 + y/7 = 1 => x + y = 7. The point (3,4) satisfies both equations."

Substitute into the first equation: 3(y - 2) + 4y = 7 => 3y - 6 + 4y = 7 => 7y = 13 => y = 13/7. Then x = 13/7 - 2 = (13 - 14)/7 = -1/7. The point is (-1/7, 13/7). The slope is 5. The equation is y - 13/7 = 5(x + 1/7). 7y - 13 = 35(x + 1/7) = 35x + 5. So, 35x - 7y + 18 = 0."

The slope of the parallel line 3x+4y=7 is -3/4. So, -(2+k)/(1+3k) = -3/4. 4(2+k) = 3(1+3k) => 8+4k = 3+9k => 5k=5 => k=1. The equation is (2x+y-5) + 1(x+3y+8) = 0, which simplifies to 3x+4y+3=0."
