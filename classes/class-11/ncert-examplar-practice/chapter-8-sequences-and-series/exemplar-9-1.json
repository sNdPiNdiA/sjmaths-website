A simpler way is to test the given points. For (0, 0): d1 = |10|/√(16+9) = 10/5 = 2. d2 = |26|/√(25+144) = 26/13 = 2. d3 = |-50|/√(49+576) = 50/25 = 2.

Thus, the vertex and the centroid must be on the same side of the line x + y - 2 = 0. For the centroid (0,0), the value of the expression is 0 + 0 - 2 = -2 (negative). For the vertex (-2, -2), the value is -2 - 2 - 2 = -6 (negative). Since both are negative, they are on the same side. The other possible vertex (2,2) gives 2+2-2=2 (positive), which is on the opposite side. Therefore, (-2, -2) is the correct vertex."
