            "answer": "$QR$",
            "solution": "For $\\triangle ABC \\cong \\triangle QRP$ by ASA congruence rule, the side included between the two equal angles must be equal.<br>In $\\triangle ABC$, the side included between $\\angle A$ and $\\angle B$ is $AB$.<br>In $\\triangle PQR$, the side included between $\\angle Q$ and $\\angle R$ is $QR$.<br>Therefore, $AB = QR$."

            "answer": "False",
            "solution": "The statement is false because the angle must be the **included angle** between the two equal sides for the SAS congruence criterion to apply. If the angle is not included (SSA), the triangles are not necessarily congruent."

            "answer": "True",
            "solution": "This statement is true. If two angles are equal, the third angle is automatically equal due to the angle sum property.<br>Thus, we can always use the ASA (if the side is included) or AAS (if the side is not included) congruence criterion."

            "solution": "In a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.<br>Here, $4 + 3 = 7$.<br>Since the sum of two sides is equal to the third side (not greater), a triangle cannot be formed."

            "solution": "Since $AB = AC$, $\\triangle ABC$ is an isosceles triangle. Angles opposite to equal sides are equal, so $\\angle C = \\angle B = 50^\\circ$. By the angle sum property of a triangle, $\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ$. So, $\\angle A + 50^\\circ + 50^\\circ = 180^\\circ$, which gives $\\angle A = 80^\\circ$."
