            "solution": "<p><strong>(i) False.</strong> The ordinate of the point $(3, 0)$ is zero. Therefore, the point lies on the x-axis, not in the first quadrant.</p><p><strong>(ii) False.</strong> The point $(1, -1)$ has a positive abscissa and negative ordinate, so it lies in the <strong>IV quadrant</strong>. The point $(-1, 1)$ has a negative abscissa and positive ordinate, so it lies in the <strong>II quadrant</strong>. They are in different quadrants.</p><p><strong>(iii) False.</strong> The coordinates of a point are written as (abscissa, ordinate). Here, abscissa $= 1$ and ordinate $= -\\frac{1}{2}$. So, the coordinates are $(1, -\\frac{1}{2})$.</p><p><strong>(iv) False.</strong> A point lying on the y-axis has its abscissa (x-coordinate) as 0. Since it is at a distance of 2 units from the x-axis, its ordinate is either 2 or -2. Thus, the coordinates are $(0, 2)$ or $(0, -2)$. The point $(2, 0)$ lies on the x-axis.</p><p><strong>(v) True.</strong> In the point $(-1, 7)$, the abscissa is negative ($-1$) and the ordinate is positive ($7$). Points with $(-x, y)$ form lie in the <strong>II quadrant</strong>.</p>"
