            "question": "The frequency distribution:<br><div class='q-table-container'><table class='q-table'><tr><th>Marks</th><td>0-20</td><td>20-40</td><td>40-60</td><td>60-100</td></tr><tr><th>Number of Students</th><td>10</td><td>15</td><td>20</td><td>25</td></tr></table></div>has been represented graphically as follows (assuming a histogram with equal widths or heights proportional to frequency). Do you think this representation is correct? Why?",
            "answer": "No",
            "solution": "The class intervals are not of equal width (0-20, 20-40, 40-60 have width 20; 60-100 has width 40). In a histogram, the area of the rectangle represents the frequency. If widths vary, the height must be adjusted (frequency density) so that area is proportional to frequency. Simply plotting frequency as height is incorrect."

            "question": "In a diagnostic test in mathematics given to students, the following marks (out of 100) are recorded: 46, 52, 48, 11, 41, 62, 54, 53, 96, 40, 98, 44. Which ‘average’ will be a good representative of the above data and why?",
            "answer": "Median",
            "solution": "The data contains extreme values (outliers) like 11, 96, and 98. The mean is sensitive to outliers and would be skewed. The median is not affected by extreme values and thus represents the central tendency better for this data."

            "answer": "Arranging data",
            "solution": "The child simply picked the middle term of the given sequence without arranging it. To find the median, data must first be arranged in ascending or descending order: 3, 5, 14, 18, 20. The correct median is 14."

            "question": "A football player scored the following number of goals in the 10 matches: 1, 3, 2, 5, 8, 6, 1, 4, 7, 9. Since the number of matches is 10 (an even number), therefore, the median = (5th observation + 6th observation) / 2 = (8 + 6) / 2 = 7. Is it the correct answer and why?",
            "answer": "No",
            "solution": "The data was not arranged in order. Arranged data: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The 5th term is 4 and the 6th term is 5. Median = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5."

            "answer": "No",
            "solution": "Class size (h) = 1.14 - 1.04 = 0.10. For the last class mark 1.64:<br>Lower limit = 1.64 - 0.10/2 = 1.59.<br>Upper limit = 1.64 + 0.10/2 = 1.69.<br>The last interval is 1.59 - 1.69."

Justify your answer.",
            "answer": "No",
            "solution": "Children watching 10 or more hours correspond to the classes 10-15 and 15-20. Total = 4 + 2 = 6 children. 22 is incorrect."

            "answer": "No",

            "answer": "No",
            "solution": "It is not correct to say it <em>will be</em> exactly 1/2. The correct statement is: As the number of tosses increases, the ratio of the number of heads to the total number of tosses <strong>approaches</strong> (or gets closer to) 1/2."
