      "question": "Read the following statement: 'An equilateral triangle is a polygon made up of three line segments out of which two line segments are equal to the third one and all its angles are $60^\\circ$ each.' Define the terms used in this definition which you feel necessary. Are there any undefined terms in this? Can you justify that all sides and all angles are equal in a equilateral triangle?",
      "solution": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The terms that need definition are:</p><ul><li><strong>Polygon:</strong> A simple closed figure made up of three or more line segments.</li><li><strong>Line segment:</strong> Part of a line with two end points.</li><li><strong>Angle:</strong> A figure formed by two rays originating from the same end point.</li><li><strong>Triangle:</strong> A polygon with three sides.</li></ul><p><strong>Undefined terms:</strong> Point, Line.</p><p><strong>Justification:</strong></p><p>By Euclid's Axiom, things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another. Here, two sides are equal to the third side, so all three sides are equal.</p>"

      "question": "Study the following statement: 'Two intersecting lines cannot be perpendicular to the same line'. Check whether it is an equivalent version of Euclid's fifth postulate.",
      "solution": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Yes, this statement is equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate.</p><p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> If two lines are perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel to each other (corresponding angles are $90^\\circ$). Therefore, they never intersect. If they are intersecting lines, they cannot both be perpendicular to the same line, otherwise they would be parallel, which contradicts the fact that they are intersecting.</p>"

Justify your answer.",
      "solution": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>No, this system of axioms is <strong>not consistent</strong>.</p><p><strong>Justification:</strong></p><p>Statement (i) says corresponding angles are not necessarily equal, while Statement (ii) says alternate interior angles are equal. We know that if alternate interior angles are equal, then corresponding angles must also be equal (since vertically opposite angles are equal). Thus, the two statements contradict each other.</p>"

Justify your answer.",
      "solution": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>No, this system of axioms is <strong>not consistent</strong>.</p><p><strong>Justification:</strong></p><p>Statement (ii) is the Linear Pair Axiom, which is true in Euclidean geometry. From the Linear Pair Axiom, we can deduce that vertically opposite angles are equal. However, Statement (i) says vertically opposite angles are <em>not</em> equal. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the system is inconsistent.</p>"
