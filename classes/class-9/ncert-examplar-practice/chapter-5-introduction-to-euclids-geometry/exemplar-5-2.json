            "solution": "Euclidean geometry is valid only for figures in the plane. It fails for curved surfaces."

            "answer": "False",
            "solution": "The statements that are proved are called theorems. Axioms are self-evident truths that are accepted without proof."

            "question": "“For every line $l$ and for every point $P$ not lying on a given line $l$, there exists a unique line $m$ passing through $P$ and parallel to $l$” is known as Playfair’s axiom.",
            "answer": "True",
            "solution": "This statement is indeed known as Playfair's axiom, which is equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate."

            "question": "Two distinct intersecting lines cannot be parallel to the same line.",
            "answer": "True",
            "solution": "If two distinct intersecting lines were both parallel to the same line, then by Playfair's axiom, they would be parallel to each other, which contradicts the fact that they intersect."

            "number": 9,
            "question": "Attempts to prove Euclid’s fifth postulate using the other postulates and axioms led to the discovery of several other geometries.",
            "answer": "True",
            "solution": "Mathematicians tried for centuries to prove the fifth postulate. These attempts eventually led to the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries (like hyperbolic and elliptic geometry) where the fifth postulate does not hold."
