    "question": "Let R be the relation defined in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} by R = {(a, b) : both a and b are either odd or even}. Show that R is an equivalence relation. Hence, find the elements of equivalence class [1].",

    "solutionSteps": [
      "Reflexive: Every number is either odd or even, so (a, a) ∈ R.",
      "Symmetric: If a and b are both odd or both even, then b and a are also both odd or both even.",
      "Transitive: If a and b are both odd/even and b and c are both odd/even, then a and c are also both odd/even.",
      "Thus, R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.",
